# WEEK 9
Java Week 9:Q1 Complete the code to develop a BASIC CALCULATOR that can perform operations like Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication and Division.

    Note the following points carefully:
    1. Use only double datatype to store calculated numeric values.
    2. Assume input to be of integer datatype.
    3. The output should be rounded using Math.round() method.
    4. Take care of the spaces during formatting output (e.g., single space each before and after =).
    5. The calculator should be able to perform required operations on a minimum of two operands as shown in the below example:

    Input:
             5+6 

    Output:
             5+6 = 11
Java Week 9:Q2 Complete the code to develop an ADVANCED CALCULATOR that emulates all the functions of the GUI Calculator as shown in the image.

GUI Calculator

    Note the following points carefully:
    1. Use only double datatype to store all numeric values.
    2. Each button on the calculator should be operated by typing the characters from 'a' to 'p'.
    3. To calculate 25-6, User should input fjhkc (where, f for 2, j for 5, h for '-', k for 6 and c for '=' ).
    3. You may use the already defined function gui_map(char).
    4. Without '=', operations won't give output as shown in Input_2 and Output_2 example below.
    5. The calculator should be able to perform required operations on two operands as shown in the below example:

    Input_1:
             klgc

    Output_1:
        18.0

    Input_2:
             klg

Output_2:
Java Week 9:Q3 Complete the code to perform a 45 degree anti clock wise rotation with respect to the center of a 5 × 5 2D Array as shown below:

    INPUT:
                  00100
                  00100
                  11111
                  00100
                  00100

    OUTPUT:

                10001
                01010
                00100
                01010
                10001

    Note the following points carefully:
    1. Here, instead of 0 and 1 any character may be given.
    2. The input and output array size must be of dimension 5 × 5 and nothing else.
Java Week 9:Q4 A program needs to be developed which can mirror reflect any 5 × 5 2D character array into its side-by-side reflection. Write suitable code to achieve this transformation as shown below:

     INPUT:                                       OUTPUT:
                   OOXOO                                        OOXOO
                   OOXOO                                        OOXOO
                   XXXOO                                        OOXXX
                   OOOOO                                        OOOOO
                   XOABC                                        CBAOX

    Note the following points carefully:
    1. Here, instead of X and O any character may be present.
    2. The input and output array size must be of dimension 5 × 5 and nothing else.
    3. Only side-by-side reflection should be performed i.e. ABC || CBA.
Java Week 9:Q5 Write suitable code to develop a 2D Flip-Flop Array with dimension 5 × 5, which replaces all input elements with values 0 by 1 and 1 by 0. An example is shown below:

    INPUT:
               00001
               00001
               00001
               00001
               00001

    OUTPUT:

               11110
               11110
               11110
               11110
               11110

    Note the following points carefully:
    1. Here, the input must contain only 0 and 1.
    2. The input and output array size must be of dimension 5 × 5.
    3. Flip-Flop: If 0 then 1 and vice-versa.
